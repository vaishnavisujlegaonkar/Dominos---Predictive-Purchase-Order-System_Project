# Dominos---Predictive-Purchase-Order-System_Project


# Overview

This project optimizes Dominosâ€™ ingredient ordering process by predicting future sales and generating efficient purchase orders. By leveraging historical sales data, the system minimizes waste, prevents stockouts, and improves inventory management.

# Business Use Cases:
1) Inventory Management: Ensuring optimal stock levels to meet future demand without overstocking.
2) Cost Reduction: Minimizing waste and reducing costs associated with expired or excess inventory.
3) Sales Forecasting: Accurately predicting sales trends to inform business strategies and promotions.
4) Supply Chain Optimization: Streamlining the ordering process to align with predicted sales and avoid disruptions.

# Approach:
1) Data Preprocessing and Exploration
- Data Cleaning: Remove any missing or inconsistent data entries, handle outliers, and format the data appropriately.
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Analyze sales trends, seasonality, and patterns in the historical sales data. Visualize the data to 
identify significant features.
2) Sales Prediction
- Feature Engineering: Create relevant features from the sales data, such as day of the week, month, promotional periods, and holiday effects.
- Model Selection: Choose an appropriate time series forecasting model (e.g., ARIMA, SARIMA, Prophet,Regression Model).
- Model Training: Train the predictive model on the historical sales data.
- Model Evaluation: Use metric Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE) to evaluate model performance.
3) Purchase Order Generation
- Sales Forecasting: Predict pizza sales for the next one week (your choice of months or weeks) using the trained model.
- Ingredient Calculation: Calculate the required quantities of each ingredient based on the predicted sales and the ingredient dataset.
- Purchase Order Creation: Generate a detailed purchase order listing the quantities of each ingredient needed for the predicted sales period.
